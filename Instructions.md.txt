Door Sensor Notes


How to view the data
  This is temprary. I will work on a website to view the data when I get home, but this is what we need to do for the first month.
  First Setup:
    open the program Git Bash
    type cd /c/doorsensor/shriDoorSensor/processing
  (Optional) Check if Nick has made any changes to the processing software
    type git pull
  Load the data from Internet onto the laptop
    python fetchData.py
  View the data
    python intervalTable.py 1
    You can access the previous command by pressing the UP arrow on the keyboard.
    Change the last number for each door (1 to 8)

  Quick Steps:
    1. git bash
    2. cd /c/doorsensor/shriDoorSensor/processing
    3. python fetchData.py
    4. python intervalTable.py 1

  To See the data online:
    go to ubidots.com
    user: shri
    password: sanrights
    Click devices
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is a new Computer, email Nick for instructions. Temporary instructions are in Google Drive.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is a software problem and we need to install new software on the devices:
  Download the new software that Nick writes onto this computer
    open Git Bash
    type: cd /c/doorsensor/shriDoorSensor
    type git pull
  Plug in each device to the laptop over USB
  Open ESP Cut
  Restart the device with the Red button in ESP Cut
  delete the "init.lua" file on the left (right click it, delete)
  Restart the device with the Red button in ESP Cut
  Select all the files in this folder: c:\doorsensor\shriDoorSensor\deploy and copy those to the device
  There is also a file in c:\doorsensor called credentials.lua, which can be uploaded to the devices, with a different name for each

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to connect the devices to Wifi daily
  If they collect data for too long without uploading, they might crash.
  Go to the site with a phone and turn on the wifi tethering hotspot feature. Make sure mobile data is turned on.
  The name must be AndroidAP and password must be sanrights
  You should see each device connect to the phone after 5 minutes.
  They disconnect when upload is complete.
  Leave the wifi network ON until all the devices have disconnected.
  This could take a long time: 30 minutes or more. Not sure. A phone with a faster internet connection will be faster.
